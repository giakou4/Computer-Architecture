# LAB 2 REPORT

#### Make things faster
In order to make the commads run sequentially we made a function in fish to execute the commads one after the other.
Then we made a call to that function and waited for the commads to be executed.

#### Questions Part 1

Run benchmarks with default cpu-clock, L1 instruction cache size and associativity , L1 data cache size and associativity,
L2 cache size and associativity and cache line
Results are presented in _spec_results1_
##### 1

##### 2

##### 3 Run benchmarks with cpu-clock=2GHz
Results are presented in _spec_results2_
